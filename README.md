## Web3Ladies-Team-Stark
For our Web3ladies final project, We were asked to build an NFT gated social board.

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out our Project.

## The challenge
* A user should be able to make posts and specify the contract address/addresses of the NFT that will be used for the gating.
* Only users with an NFT/NFTs should be able to view posts based on the NFTs the author specified. 
* An interface that would show posts to users depending on if they hold an NFT. Example: If you hold a Bored Ape NFT you should be able to view a post
